//More about colors:
//Lower 3 digits are foreground, 
//and higher 3 digits are background
//Each of 3 digits shows amount of
//RED, GREEN, and BLUE (in order)
//Each color has 10 shades - from 0 to 9
//
//For example, 999044 will be dark yellow (044) on
//a white background (999)
//
//Experiment with colors!
//
//Also, the 7th digit (if its not equal to 0) will
//cause the character to blink by changing foreground and
//background places (actual data in memory wont change)
