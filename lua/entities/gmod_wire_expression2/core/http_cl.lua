	Clientside HTTP library

]]

--	Clientside HTTP is separate from serverside HTTP:
--		Serverside HTTP allows greater speeds than clientside HTTP and it is
--		up to the server owner to decide which extension should be enabled
--		through a convar (found in core/http.lua)

--	This library will mirror the functionality of core/http.lua as best as
--	possible, making sure any existing e2s which make use of the http library
--	are not broken by this extension

E2Lib.clHTTP = {}
local lib = E2Lib.clHTTP

lib.requests = {}

-- string function(void)
function lib:newUID()
	return ("0x%08xf"):format(math.random(1,0xD4A51000))-- return 0x(hex) between 0 and 10^12
end
